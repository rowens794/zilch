## Welcome to Zilch

Zilch is a dice game that allows players to compete against each other in a race to 10,000 points. Points are awarded based of a list of "hands" and players must roll a scorable "hand" on every turn or forfeit the points they've been awarded.

## This project - Philosophy

I wanted to build an implementation of the game zilch that allowed players to easily connect with friends and play with their phones. I wanted to avoid the hassle of account creation and built the game to allow players to join with just a 3 digit game code.
